   * Set up a swipe gesture.  Hammer has a 'swipe' event but
   * it's not particularly reliable in my experience, so I fake it
   * by detecting drags and deciding if it was a swipe based on the distance.
   *
   * Note that this just takes distance into account - you could do a slow drag 
   * and it would still get picked up as a 'swipe' using this method. You would
   * need to get time deltas between the drag start and end if you wanted to check
   * the speed of the drag as well.
